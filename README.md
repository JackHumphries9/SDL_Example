<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I wanted to learn C++ and CMake and I wanted to learn SDL, so I made this project. It's a simple app where a square floats around the screen. It's not very exciting, but it's a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn SDL.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
